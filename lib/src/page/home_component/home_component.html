        <span>six robots are randomly prepared for competition. Use them 'as is' or click on the blue bar to instantly adjust their capabilities. Then go to</span>
        <span class="link" (click)="router.navigate(['RunSimulation'])">Power Up!</span>
        <span>and start the match. Watch them scurry around to fulfill the their default strategies, and see the points stack up.</span>

<h2>Take Control</h2>

            <span>You can drive robot 'Red 1' simply by toggling 'I want to drive this robot' in </span>
            <span class="link" (click)="router.navigate(['Configure'])">Prepare the Robots</span>

        <p>
            A fun way to start is to make your robot (Red 1) a super robot, and make all the others not so good.

        <p>
            <span>Don't worry if your robot occaisionally takes an amusing detour on its way to a destination. The simulator calculates how long the robot should take, and the animation is tuned to take that long.</span>

<h2>Tweak the Robot</h2>
<p>
    <span>Click on 'More Configuration Options' to reveal 2 more blue bars to specify the robot's speed of movement and agility at manipulating cubes.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>'Performance Details' shows the editable performance specs. Notice that changing any of the blue sliders affects these values instantly. You can observe your team's actual robot and enter the values here to get an idea of how it might perform in competition. Disclaimer: The perfomance range from 'Basic Bot' to 'Super Bot' is arbitrary and may not reflect actual robot performance.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>In 'Performance Details' you'll see entries for '% Variation' and '% Failure'. These numbers are used to calculate semi-random robot behaviors. [Note: '% Failure' is not yet implemented]</span>
